# sc-explorer
## This script uses undocumented soundcloud APIs (since you cannot currently ask for an api key). Use it at your own risk! (your soundcloud account might get banned)
## NOT FINISHED, UNDER DEVELOPMENT
TODO: explore different genres (currently hiphop-rap is hardcoded) (easy)
TODO: actually add liked songs to a playlist (easy)
TODO: develop an actual algorithm to suggest better songs based on previously liked ones? (idk)
TODO: GUI?

Idea taken from https://twitter.com/yush_g (https://github.com/Divide-By-0/ideas-for-projects-people-would-use)

## How to use
Get your client_id from soundcloud (you can use the developer console from any browser) and save it in a file named client_id (located in the same directory as the python script).
